1. Program: Given 2 arrays that are sorted, merge this two arrays into one big one
   Input  = [0, 3, 4, 31], [4, 6, 30]
   Output = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 30, 31]


2. Problem: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that 
   they add up to target.

   You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

   You can return the answer in any order.
   Example 1:

   Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
   Output: [0,1]
   Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
   Example 2:

   Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
   Output: [1,2]
   Example 3:

   Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
   Output: [0,1]
