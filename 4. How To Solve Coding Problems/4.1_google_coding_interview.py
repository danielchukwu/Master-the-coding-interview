# Python - 3.10
# Topic - White Board Coding Interview
# program - I am going to give you a collection of numbers, and i need you to take this collection of numbers and find a matching pair that is equal to a sum that i am going to give you as well
# Inputs(arrays) and outputs(sum)
# collection 1 : [1, 2, 3, 9] sum = 8
# collection 2 : [1, 2, 4, 4] sum = 8

# Starting the coding interview
# 1st: Step by step through the problem 1-5
# Ans 1: in collection 1 there is no pair of numbers that add up to 8 ‚úÖ            - No
# Ans 2: in collection 2 we have a pair in the collection that adds up to 8(4, 4)   - Yes

# How are this numbers given, can i assume that they are in memory? 
# Interviewer = Yes they are in memory, you can go with an array and you can also assume that they are in order

# Can i repeat elements at the same index in my solution?
# Interviewer = No, you are not allowed to they have to be different pairs

# Are the numbers in the array always integers or are they floating point?
# Interviewer = You can assume that they'll always be integers



# ANSWER - 1st Try
# Ans: The simplest solution that comes to mind would be to compare every single possible pair in an array using a double for loop without repeating - and that would leave us with an O(n^2) time complexity, Lol - not very efficient but that would be 1 way to solve it
# Interviewer - True, that would work but very time consuming and costly for the company - so if you could find an algorithm better than a Quadratic time that the collection is sorted in an ascsending order

# ANSWER - 2nd Try
# Ans: we could start with the first element and brinary search the rest of the array for a match and then binary search the next element then binary search the rest for a match and so on
# Interviewer - True, Valid answer but that would still be too costly since you are doing a log n for finding and an n for each iteration --> we would be left with an O(n log n) and that's still too costly

# ANSWER - 3rd Tru+
# Okay Let me think - How about at the start of the problem i use 2 pointers(pointing to start and end)
# e.g [1, 2, 3, 9]
#      ^        ^
# and check the sum = if it equals 8 --> and if it does we have found a pair soo we stop the program
# But if it doesn't we check
#    - is sum greater than 8 --> if True we move the lastpointer -1
# e.g [1, 2, 3, 9]
#      ^     ^
#    - now is sum = to 8 --> if True we have found a pair but if false --> is sum greater than or less than 8
#    - if sum less than 8 --> is True we move the firstpointer +1
# e.g [1, 2, 3, 9]
#         ^  ^
# and by doing this we should end up with a Linear Time Complexity O(n)
#
# Interviewer - Okay we could do that, but you explained it in a non working example, how about you do that explanation again but in a working one(hint: using collection2)

# -- PAUSE --
# NOTICE - At this point you are owning the interview - you are the absolute BOSS right now
# -- PLAY --

# Now when our loop starts - we sum the first and the last item in the array and if they are equal = to 8 we found a pair -- program ends‚úÖ
# If not
# if less than 8 - we move the firstpointer +1
# and if greater than - we move the lastpointer -1
# repeat step 55 and 56 over and over again until we find a pair that sums up to 8 - but if we don't and 
# if last index and first index become thesame we exit the program - no pair was found
# e.g [1, 2, 4, 4]
#      ^        ^  == 1 + 4 = 5 < 8 --> move 1st pointer +1
# e.g [1, 2, 4, 4]
#         ^     ^  == 2 + 4 = 6 < 8 --> move 1st pointer +1
# e.g [1, 2, 4, 4]
#            ^  ^  == 4 + 4 = 8 == 8  --> MATCH FOUND‚≠ê - Program Ends with Linear Time Complexity

# INTERVIEWER - GOOD JOB ‚≠ê. So which programming language would you like to use to solve this problem
# Ans - Well i personally would prefer using Pythonüêç
# INTERVIEWER - Go For It. (she says to herself **I already love him - what a great guy. he has all the skills i am looking for)

# You - I just remembered i don't know how i am supposed to return this. Should it be a yes i found it or the indexes of the pair or the actual pairs
# Interviewer - I would prefer you return if you found it or not. But let's say you were going to return a pair, how could that be a problem returning a pair if there wasn't no pair
# Ans - well i guess i could return a data structure that holds a boolean found; and a pair if any
# e.g - { found: false, pair: ""}
# Interviewer - Well rather than going with a custom object how about you just return a Boolean


# Okay Let's get coding in Python üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

def hasPairWithSum(collection, sum):
   low = 0
   hi = len(collection) - 1
   while low < hi:
      added = collection[low] + collection[hi]

      if added == sum:
         return True
      elif added > sum:
         hi -= 1
         continue
      elif added < sum:
         low +=1
         continue
   return False

result = hasPairWithSum([1, 2, 3, 9], 8) # O(n)
# print(f"Pair Found: {result}")


# Interviewer - Excellent answer‚úÖ, but i'd like to throw a little runch in there. What if the collections are no longer sorted. How would you then solve this problem to achieve an O(n) Big O notation
# Ans: Well first off in order to solve this problem the same way with our above O(n) Algorithm we would have to sort it at the top of the function. Which would be an O(n log n) Time Complexity
# Interviewer - well that's too slow, Google needs something faster ** she giggles

# ANSWER - 4th
# Ans - Okay, well since that won't work i am thinking iterating through each item in the collection and then adding the compliment of each item --> As i progress in the iteration, i am asking current number, is this current number in our compliments (using a hash table data structure for lookup O(1) and insertion O(1)) --> if so we've seen a previous number whose compliment adds up to == sum --> return True else: add current number to compliments and move to the next iteration
# e.g [1‚Å∑, 2, 3, 9]  --> is 1 a compliment of any value seen before | compliments = {} | answer = No
#      ^
#     compliment = {7}
#     [1‚Å∑, 2‚Å∂, 3, 9]  --> is 2 a compliment of any value seen before | compliments = {7} | answer = No
#          ^
#     compliment = {7, 6}
#     [1‚Å∑, 2‚Å∂, 3‚Åµ, 9]  --> is 3 a compliment of any value seen before | compliments = {7, 6} | answer = No
#              ^
#     compliment = {7, 6, 5}
#     [1‚Å∑, 2‚Å∂, 3‚Åµ, 9¬Ø¬π]  --> is 9 a compliment of any value seen before | compliments = {7, 6, 5} | answer = No
#                   ^
#     compliment = {7, 6, 5, -1}

# Interviewer - That sounds great to me. how about we get to coding
# e.g collection1 = [1, 2, 3, 9]
# e.g collection2 = [1, 2, 4, 4]
def hasPairWithSum2(collection, sum):
   compliments = set() # set add and in operations use an underlying hash table as it's data structure -- and hash tables have an insertion and access of O(1) Constant Time
   for value in collection:
      if value in compliments: # if current value is a compliment to a value we've seen before
         return True
      
      compliments.add(sum - value)
   print(compliments)
   return False

result2 = hasPairWithSum2([1, 2, 4, 9], 8) # O(n) 
print(result2)
